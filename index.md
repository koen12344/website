Like they always say in The Netherlands: "The faucet leaks at the plumbers house". I'm usually busy working on other projects 
while my personal website gets a bit neglected. You know how it goes.

I figured setting up a simple website would 
look a bit more professional than the "403 Forbidden" error that dominated this page for the past
couple of years. 

Don't expect regular updates here!
