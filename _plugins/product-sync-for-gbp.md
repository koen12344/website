The [Product Sync for GBP](https://tycoonmedia.net/product-sync-for-gbp/) plugin lets you sync your WooCommerce product catalog to your Google Business Profile listing. 

Officially the Google Business Profile API doesn't support creating products. They can only be created within their web interface, so I had to figure out a workaround!

The plugin mimics your browser session in order to create them.
