My first plugin in the [WordPress plugin repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-to-google-my-business/). 
Released in 2018 and still actively maintained. The plugin currently has over 8000 active installs and holds 100+ 5-star reviews. 

Post to Google My Business lets you (auto-)publish your WordPress posts to your Google Business Profile.
Alongside that it has advanced features for managing GBP posts at scale, making it a great and affordable
solution for webdev- & SEO agencies to manage GBP posts for customers.
